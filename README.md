# pikaserver.prototype

The rewrote prototype of the pikaserver. It will run on the benpigchu.com in future.

For current using version, see `legacy-master` branch.

The project is designed as a single-file single-domain site server with advanced configable static file serving feature, js extension and some util. But also it's possible to add multi-domain support and more complex feature without modify the script itself.

We do not expect it to be used in any sites bisides benpigchu.com, but nothing prevent you from using this script.
